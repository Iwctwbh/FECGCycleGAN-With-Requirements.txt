For training the model use code in test.test_CycleGAN
During first 5 iterations of training make sure the network is not producing high variance noise. If so, just re run training. 
We are working to solve this problem.
Two pre-trained model are saved in test set which were converged and could get >90 R2 on MECG<->FECG
